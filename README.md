<div style="text-align: justify "> Through this document, you can find a way to understand the structure of this repository, which contains our solutions to the fourth homework proposed in the subject.
 </div>

## Repository description

In this repository you can find the next folders/files:



#### 1. `main.ipynb` file

> This file contains the solution to all the 6 questions (and its corresponding literals) required for the activity: Explore Wikipedia's hyperlinks network.
- To visualize correctly the content of this Notebook we recommend you access to [THIS]() page or to download the Notebook in your PC and open it from Anaconda. It is mainly because from GitHub you can't see the plots made with `Plotly express`.

#### 2. `our_functions.py` file
> This file contains the functions that we created to execute some chunks of the code, keeping it tidy and easy-to-read.

#### 3. `README.md` file
> This file contains the explanation of the structure of this repository (it is the actual file that you are reading).

#### 4. `img` folder
> This folder contains images and gifs that we load in this file and also in the Jupyter Notebook that provides the solution.

<div style="text-align: justify ">We hope the previous information was clear and useful to navigate over the repository and understand our solutions. </div>
